          A senior fullstack consultant with 15+ years delivering
          high-performance, scalable web applications for blue-chip clients —
          from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America to Visa and Deutsche Bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          An early adopter of React, with deep expertise spanning every major
          version from 0.13 to 18, and a track record of bringing it into
          organisations before it became mainstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strong eye for design and UX, with a habit of dogfooding work
          personally — features are QA&apos;d before they ship, eliminating the
          &quot;chuck it over the fence&quot; bottleneck and getting polished,
          production-ready work into users&apos; hands faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          This CV is intentionally published as both Vanilla JS and React
          versions to demonstrate the same product thinking and UX decisions
          across different delivery styles — useful when teams need either
          framework flexibility or zero-dependency performance.
